# Creosynth playbook

Creating a playbook file from source is extremely easy:
- Download the source
- Download VisualCppRedist into Executables\VCRuntimes (a link to download is in that directory). You may also replace ZwTimerResolution, ViveTool & ExplorerPatcher with your own files.
- Use software such as 7-Zip or PeaZip to create a .7z archive of the playbook
- Apply the "malte" password to the archive but don't encrypt file names
- Change the extension to ".apbx"
- The playbook file is now ready to be used
