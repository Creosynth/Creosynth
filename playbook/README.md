# Creosynth playbook

Creating a playbook file from source is extremely easy:
- Download the source.
- Download VisualCppRedist into Executables\VCRuntimes (a link to download is in that directory). You may also replace ZwTimerResolution and ViveTool with your own files.
- Use software such as 7-Zip or PeaZip to create an .7z archive of the playbook.
- Apply the "malte" password to the archive without encrypting file names.
- Change the extension to ".apbx".
- The playbook file is now ready to be used.
